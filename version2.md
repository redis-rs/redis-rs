# Announcing redis-rs & redis-test 2.0.0

With version 1.0.0 behind us, version 2.0.0 begins a new major series, with redis-test tracking it with the same version.

This document highlights the breaking changes in version 2.0.0. For a complete list of changes, see CHANGELOG.md. We appreciate feedback and bug reports — please open an issue for anything you encounter during migration. In order to get the newest version, please specify in your Cargo.toml file

```toml
redis = "2"
```

## Breaking Changes

### TCP_NODELAY is now enabled by default (Breaking Change)

By default, Nagle's algorithm is now disabled on every TCP connection the crate creates (sync and async, plaintext and TLS). Previously it was left enabled, which serialized writes on a multiplexed connection to one per ACK round-trip under concurrency — measured at 39–68% lower throughput and roughly double the p50 latency on a real network (see [#2195](https://github.com/redis-rs/redis-rs/issues/2195) for the full evidence). Sequential request-response traffic is unaffected, and Redis clients in other ecosystems already ship with TCP_NODELAY enabled.

No API changed, but the wire behavior did: the client now emits more, smaller packets at moderate concurrency. Deployments close to packets-per-second limits (small cloud instances) or on metered/WAN links may prefer the old behavior.

**Migration:** nothing to do for most users — expect lower latency and higher multiplexed throughput. To keep Nagle's algorithm:

```rust
use redis::{IntoConnectionInfo, io::tcp::TcpSettings};

let info = "redis://127.0.0.1/".into_connection_info()?
    .set_tcp_settings(TcpSettings::default().set_nodelay(false));
```

### `cmd_iter` yields `CmdRef` instead of `&Cmd` (Breaking Change)

**Most users can upgrade to 2.0.0 with no code changes.** The flattening is an internal representation change; the pipeline builder API (`cmd`, `arg`, `add_command`, `ignore`, `query`, `query_async`, `exec`, …) is unchanged. The only adjustments are needed if you iterate a pipeline's commands or call `with_capacity` directly.

Because a pipeline no longer owns a `Vec<Cmd>`, there is no `&Cmd` to hand out. [`Pipeline::cmd_iter`] and [`ClusterPipeline::cmd_iter`] now yield `CmdRef<'_>`, a lightweight, `Copy` view that borrows directly into the pipeline's shared buffers — iterating a pipeline's commands performs no per-command allocation.

`CmdRef` is intentionally opaque so that the underlying storage can keep evolving. It exposes the read-only accessors you previously reached for on `&Cmd`, including `args_iter()`, `arg_idx()`, `data()`, `cursor()`, `is_no_response()`, and `get_packed_command()`. If you genuinely need an owned `Cmd`, call `to_cmd()`.

**Migration:** Update code that iterates a pipeline's commands. Most call sites only need to drop a borrow or call an accessor:

```rust
// Before:
for cmd in pipe.cmd_iter() {
    let name = cmd.arg_idx(0);
    // cmd: &Cmd
}

// After:
for cmd in pipe.cmd_iter() {
    let name = cmd.arg_idx(0);
    // cmd: CmdRef<'_> — same read accessors, Copy
}
```

If you stored or passed the `&Cmd` onward and need an owned value:

```rust
// Before:
let owned: Vec<Cmd> = pipe.cmd_iter().cloned().collect();

// After:
let owned: Vec<Cmd> = pipe.cmd_iter().map(|cmd| cmd.to_cmd()).collect();
```

### `Pipeline::with_capacity` is replaced by `reserve_for_*` methods (Breaking Change)

[`Pipeline::with_capacity`] and [`ClusterPipeline::with_capacity`] have been removed. A flattened pipeline stores its commands across three buffers (commands, arguments, and argument bytes), and a single capacity number no longer maps cleanly onto them. Rather than force you to estimate all three up front, pre-allocation is now opt-in per buffer via chainable methods, so you reserve only the dimensions you actually have a number for:

```rust
pub fn reserve_for_commands(&mut self, additional: usize) -> &mut Self
pub fn reserve_for_args(&mut self, additional: usize) -> &mut Self
pub fn reserve_for_data(&mut self, additional: usize) -> &mut Self // argument bytes
```

**Migration:** Replace `with_capacity` with the reservations you can estimate:

```rust
// Before:
let mut pipe = redis::Pipeline::with_capacity(16); // 16 commands

// After: reserve whichever buffers you have an estimate for
let mut pipe = redis::pipe();
pipe.reserve_for_commands(16).reserve_for_args(48);
```

`Pipeline::new()` and `pipe()` are unchanged.
