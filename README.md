Redis-rs is a high level Rust library for Redis, Valkey and any other RESP 
(Redis Serialization Protocol) compliant DB. It provides convenient access
to all Redis functionality through a very flexible but low-level API. It
uses a customizable type conversion trait so that any operation can return
results in just the type you are expecting. This makes for a very pleasant
development experience.

The crate is called `redis` and you can depend on it via cargo:

```ini
[dependencies]
redis = "1.0.0-rc.2"
```

Documentation on the library can be found at
[docs.rs/redis](https://docs.rs/redis).

## Basic Operation

To open a connection you need to create a client and then to fetch a
connection from it.

Many commands are implemented through the `TypedCommands` or `Commands` traits but manual
command creation is also possible. The `TypedCommands` trait provides pre-specified and opinionated return value types to commands,
but if you want to use other return value types, you can use `Commands` as long as the chosen return value type
implements the `FromRedisValue` trait.

```rust
use redis::TypedCommands;

fn fetch_an_integer() -> redis::RedisResult<isize> {
	// connect to redis
	let client = redis::Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1/")?;
	let mut con = client.get_connection()?;
	// `set` returns a `()`, so we don't need to specify the return type manually unlike in the previous example.
	con.set("my_key", 42)?;
	// `get_int` returns Option<isize>, as the key may not be found.
	con.get_int("my_key").unwrap()
}
```

```rust
use redis::Commands;

fn fetch_an_integer() -> redis::RedisResult<isize> {
    // connect to redis
    let client = redis::Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1/")?;
    let mut con = client.get_connection()?;
    // throw away the result, just make sure it does not fail
    let _: () = con.set("my_key", 42)?;
    // read back the key and return it.  Because the return value
    // from the function is a result for integer this will automatically
    // convert into one.
    con.get("my_key")
}
```

Variables are converted to and from the Redis format for a wide variety of types
(`String`, num types, tuples, `Vec<u8>`). If you want to use it with your own types,
you can implement the `FromRedisValue` and `ToRedisArgs` traits, or derive it with the
[redis-macros](https://github.com/daniel7grant/redis-macros/#json-wrapper-with-redisjson) crate.

## Async support

To enable asynchronous clients, enable the relevant feature in your Cargo.toml,
`tokio-comp` for tokio users, `smol-comp` for smol users.

```
# if you use tokio
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["tokio-comp"] }

# if you use smol
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["smol-comp"] }
```

You can then use either the `AsyncTypedCommands` or `AsyncCommands` traits. All async connections are cheap to clone, and clones can be used concurrently from multiple threads.

## Connection Pooling

When using a sync connection, it is recommended to use a connection pool in order to handle
disconnects or multi-threaded usage. This can be done using the `r2d2` feature.

```
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["r2d2"] }
```

For async connections, connection pooling isn't necessary, unless blocking commands are used.
The `MultiplexedConnection` is cheaply cloneable and can be used safely from multiple threads, so a 
single connection can be easily reused. For automatic reconnections consider using 
`ConnectionManager` with the `connection-manager` feature.
Async cluster connections also don't require pooling and are thread-safe and reusable.

Multiplexing won't help if blocking commands are used since the server won't handle commands
from blocked connections until the connection is unblocked. If you want to be able to handle
non-blocking commands concurrently with blocking commands, you should send the blocking
commands on another connection.

## TLS Support

To enable TLS support, you need to use the relevant feature entry in your Cargo.toml.
Currently, `native-tls` and `rustls` are supported.

To use `native-tls`:

```
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["tls-native-tls"] }

# if you use tokio
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["tokio-native-tls-comp"] }

# if you use smol
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["smol-native-tls-comp"] }
```

To use `rustls`:

```
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["tls-rustls"] }

# if you use tokio
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["tokio-rustls-comp"] }

# if you use smol
redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["smol-rustls-comp"] }
```

Add `rustls` to dependencies

```
rustls = { version = "0.23" }
```

And then, before creating a connection, ensure that you install a crypto provider. For example:

```rust
    rustls::crypto::ring::default_provider()
        .install_default()
        .expect("Failed to install rustls crypto provider");
```


With `rustls`, you can add the following feature flags on top of other feature flags to enable additional features:

-   `tls-rustls-insecure`: Allow insecure TLS connections
-   `tls-rustls-webpki-roots`: Use `webpki-roots` (Mozilla's root certificates) instead of native root certificates

then you should be able to connect to a redis instance using the `rediss://` URL scheme:

```rust
let client = redis::Client::open("rediss://127.0.0.1/")?;
```

To enable insecure mode, append `#insecure` at the end of the URL:

```rust
let client = redis::Client::open("rediss://127.0.0.1/#insecure")?;
```

## Token-Based Authentication with Azure Entra ID

Redis-rs supports token-based authentication using Azure Entra ID, providing secure, dynamic authentication for Redis connections. This feature is particularly useful for Azure-hosted applications and enterprise environments.

To enable Entra ID authentication, add the `entra-id` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
redis = { version = "0.32.7", features = ["entra-id", "tokio-comp"] }
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use redis::{Client, Commands, EntraIdCredentialsProvider, TokenRefreshConfig};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> redis::RedisResult<()> {
    // Create credentials provider using DefaultAzureCredential
    let mut provider = EntraIdCredentialsProvider::new_default()?;
    // Start the background refresh service, which will automatically refresh the token
    provider.start(TokenRefreshConfig::default());

    // Create Redis client with credentials provider
    let client = Client::open("redis://your-redis-instance.com:6380")?
        .with_credentials_provider(provider);

    // Use the client to get a multiplexed connection.
    // Since the client has an attached credentials provider, it will create a background task, which will subscribe for token updates.
    // The client automatically re-authenticates itself once it receives new credentials from the stream.
    let mut con = client.get_multiplexed_async_connection().await?;
    redis::cmd("SET")
        .arg("my_key")
        .arg(42i32)
        .exec_async(&mut con)
        .await?;
    let result: Option<String> = redis::cmd("GET")
        .arg("my_key")
        .query_async(&mut con)
        .await?;
    println!("Value: {:?}", result);

    Ok(())
}
```

For detailed documentation and examples, see [redis/docs/token_authentication.md](redis/docs/token_authentication.md).

## Cluster Support

Support for Redis Cluster can be enabled by enabling the `cluster` feature in your Cargo.toml:

`redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = [ "cluster"] }`

Then you can simply use the `ClusterClient`, which accepts a list of available nodes. Note
that only one node in the cluster needs to be specified when instantiating the client, though
you can specify multiple.

```rust
use redis::cluster::ClusterClient;
use redis::TypedCommands;

fn fetch_an_integer() -> String {
    let nodes = vec!["redis://127.0.0.1/"];
    let client = ClusterClient::new(nodes).unwrap();
    let mut connection = client.get_connection().unwrap();
    connection.set("test", "test_data").unwrap();
    return connection.get("test").unwrap();
}
```

Async Redis Cluster support can be enabled by enabling the `cluster-async` feature, along
with your preferred async runtime, e.g.:

`redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = [ "cluster-async", "tokio-std-comp" ] }`

```rust
use redis::cluster::ClusterClient;
use redis::AsyncTypedCommands;

async fn fetch_an_integer() -> String {
    let nodes = vec!["redis://127.0.0.1/"];
    let client = ClusterClient::new(nodes).unwrap();
    let mut connection = client.get_async_connection().await.unwrap();
    connection.set("test", "test_data").await.unwrap();
    return connection.get("test").await.unwrap();
}
```

## JSON Support

Support for the RedisJSON Module can be enabled by specifying "json" as a feature in your Cargo.toml.

`redis = { version = "1.0.0-rc.2", features = ["json"] }`

Then you can simply import the `JsonCommands` trait which will add the `json` commands to all Redis Connections (not to be confused with just `Commands` which only adds the default commands)

```rust
use redis::Client;
use redis::JsonCommands;
use redis::RedisResult;
use redis::ToRedisArgs;

// Result returns Ok(true) if the value was set
// Result returns Err(e) if there was an error with the server itself OR serde_json was unable to serialize the boolean
fn set_json_bool<P: ToRedisArgs>(key: P, path: P, b: bool) -> RedisResult<bool> {
    let client = Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1").unwrap();
    let connection = client.get_connection().unwrap();

    // runs `JSON.SET {key} {path} {b}`
    connection.json_set(key, path, b)?
}

```

To parse the results, you'll need to use `serde_json` (or some other json lib) to deserialize
the results from the bytes. It will always be a `Vec`, if no results were found at the path it'll
be an empty `Vec`. If you want to handle deserialization and `Vec` unwrapping automatically,
you can use the `Json` wrapper from the
[redis-macros](https://github.com/daniel7grant/redis-macros/#json-wrapper-with-redisjson) crate.

## Webassembly Support

redis-rs tests that webassembly succesfully builds for the sync client work, but today async support isn't enabled, and the webassembly builds aren't tested against a database.

## Development

To test `redis` you're going to need to be able to test with the Redis Modules, to do this
you must set the following environment variable before running the test script

-   `REDIS_RS_REDIS_JSON_PATH` = The absolute path to the RedisJSON module (Either `librejson.so` for Linux or `librejson.dylib` for MacOS).

-   Please refer to this [link](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON) to access the RedisJSON module:

<!-- As support for modules are added later, it would be wise to update this list -->

If you want to develop on the library there are a few commands provided
by the makefile:

To build the core crate:

    $ cargo build --locked -p redis

To test:

Note: `make test` requires cargo-nextest installed, to learn more about it please visit [homepage of cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/).


    $ make test
    
To run benchmarks:

    $ make bench

To build the docs (require nightly compiler, see [rust-lang/rust#43781](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43781)):

    $ make docs

We encourage you to run `clippy` prior to seeking a merge for your work. The lints can be quite strict. Running this on your own workstation can save you time, since Travis CI will fail any build that doesn't satisfy `clippy`:

    $ cargo clippy --all-features --all --tests --examples -- -D clippy::all -D warnings

To run fuzz tests with afl, first install cargo-afl (`cargo install -f afl`),
then run:

    $ make fuzz

If the fuzzer finds a crash, in order to reproduce it, run:

    $ cd afl/<target>/
    $ cargo run --bin reproduce -- out/crashes/<crashfile>
