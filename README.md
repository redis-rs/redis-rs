Redis-rs is a high level redis library for Rust.  It provides convenient access
to all Redis functionality through a very flexible but low-level API.  It
uses a customizable type conversion trait so that any operation can return
results in just the type you are expecting.  This makes for a very pleasant
development experience.

The crate is called `redis` and you can depend on it via cargo:

```ini
[dependencies]
redis = "0.14.0"
```

Documentation on the library can be found at
[docs.rs/redis](https://docs.rs/redis).

**Note: redis-rs requires at least Rust 1.39.**

## Basic Operation

To open a connection you need to create a client and then to fetch a
connection from it.  In the future there will be a connection pool for
those, currently each connection is separate and not pooled.

Many commands are implemented through the `Commands` trait but manual
command creation is also possible.

```rust
extern crate redis;
use redis::Commands;

fn fetch_an_integer() -> redis::RedisResult<isize> {
    // connect to redis
    let client = redis::Client::open("redis://127.0.0.1/")?;
    let mut con = client.get_connection()?;
    // throw away the result, just make sure it does not fail
    let _ : () = con.set("my_key", 42)?;
    // read back the key and return it.  Because the return value
    // from the function is a result for integer this will automatically
    // convert into one.
    con.get("my_key")
}
```

## Development
