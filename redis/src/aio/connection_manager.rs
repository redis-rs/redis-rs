/// A `ConnectionManager` is a proxy that wraps a [multiplexed
/// connection][multiplexed-connection] and automatically reconnects to the
/// server when necessary.
///
/// Like the [`MultiplexedConnection`][multiplexed-connection], this
/// manager can be cloned, allowing requests to be be sent concurrently on
/// the same underlying connection (tcp/unix socket).
///
/// ## Behavior
///
/// - When creating an instance of the `ConnectionManager`, an initial
///   connection will be established and awaited. Connection errors will be
///   returned directly.
/// - When a command sent to the server fails with an error that represents
///   a "connection dropped" condition, that error will be passed on to the
///   user, but it will trigger a reconnection in the background.
/// - The reconnect code will atomically swap the current (dead) connection
///   with a future that will eventually resolve to a `MultiplexedConnection`
///   or to a `RedisError`
/// - All commands that are issued after the reconnect process has been
///   initiated, will have to await the connection future.
/// - If reconnecting fails, all pending commands will be failed as well. A
///   new reconnection attempt will be triggered if the error is an I/O error.
